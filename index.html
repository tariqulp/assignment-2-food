                    <p>Argentina win the Copa America title for the first time since 1993 as they beat Brazil 1-0 in the
                        final at the historic Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. Angel Di Maria scored the only goal of
                        the
                        match in the 22nd minute. This is Lionel Messi's first major trophy with the Argentina senior
                        team.
