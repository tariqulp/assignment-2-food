                                The 2021 Copa América was the 47th edition of the Copa América, the international men's
                                football championship organised by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The
                                tournament took place in Brazil from 13 June to 10 July 2021.[2] The tournament was
                                originally scheduled to take place from 12 June to 12 July 2020 in Argentina and
                                Colombia as the 2020 Copa América. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that due to the
                                COVID-19 pandemic in South America, the tournament had been postponed for a year, in
                                conjunction with UEFA's decision to also postpone UEFA Euro 2020 to 2021.[3] This was
                                the first time since 1991 where no guest nation took part in the tournament.
